## About Me

I build things that solve real security and data problems.

My work spans cybersecurity engineering, automation, and applied AI. I enjoy the intersection of offensive and defensive security: understanding how things break, then designing systems that prevent or detect those breakpoints.

I also actively compete in cybersecurity competitions and design original CTF challenges.

## What I Work On

• Full-stack applications that automate complex workflows  
• Data-driven security tools that reduce manual effort  
• Research projects using scraping, pattern analysis, and dataset creation  
• Policy and governance projects involving real organizations and compliance

I believe technology should remove friction, not add to it — especially in security.
